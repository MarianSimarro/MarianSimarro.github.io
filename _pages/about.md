My primary research interest lies at the intersection of language and communication, using computational and behavioural neuroscience. I'm a PhD student at the Max Plank School of Cognition. Currently, I'm visiting the Lise Meitner Research Group Neurobiosocial at Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences  under the supervision of [Dr. Sofie Louise Valk](https://https://cng-lab.github.io/).

Outside of research, I am often busy exploring the outdoors, on foot or by bike, and taking pictures. In my spare time, I also enjoy playing clarinet, baking and a good book. 

Navigating higher education and academia is daunting for many, and particularly so for underrepresented groups. Throughout my training, I am privileged to have had mentors who continue to support and encourage me in my work, education, and beyond. I am committed to promoting access to higher education and academia and to mentoring students from all backgrounds.

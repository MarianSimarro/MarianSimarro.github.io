My primary research interest lies at the intersection of language and communication, using computational and behavioural neuroscience. I'm a PhD student at the Max Plank School of Cognition under the supervision of [Dr. Caroline Rowland](https://www.mpi.nl/people/rowland-caroline). Currently, I'm visiting the University of TÃ¼bingen where I'm exploring how gist memory formation during sleep differs in ADHD and autistic children. Using high-density EEG, I investigate the neural correlates of altered memory consolidation processes during sleep. 

Outside of research, I am often busy exploring the outdoors, on foot or by bike, and taking pictures. In my spare time, I also enjoy playing clarinet, baking and a good book. 

Navigating higher education and academia is daunting for many, and particularly so for underrepresented groups. Throughout my training, I am privileged to have had mentors who continue to support and encourage me in my work, education, and beyond. I am committed to promoting access to higher education and academia and to mentoring students from all backgrounds.
